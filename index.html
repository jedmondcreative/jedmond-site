                I was born in Washington DC at Providence Hospital. My parents brought me home on the 2nd day and I was immediately a Marylander upon touching down at home. I was a pretty happy baby by all accounts and easy to handle when rearing. I lived on a steep hill in the town of Lewisdale which was a diverse and burgeoning neighborhood.

                My passion: I'm really into drawing and sketching mostly in my down time. My dream is to make it big in the comicbook industry. If I can spend enough time practicing my craft I know I should be able to fulfill my potential.

                A fun fact: Working with so many different companies and organizations has given me a great span of different skills and abilities and opportunities to use them. It is amazing to me that I've been able to get such a mix of paying jobs and at the same time hold my own in each position.
